Looks like the Yum repo didn’t link or the package naming changed. Let’s install Vector directly using the RPM—this is reliable and straightforward.


---

✅ Step 1: Download the latest RPM

From the Vector GitHub releases:

cd /tmp
sudo curl -L -O https://yum.vector.dev/stable/vector-0.48.0-1.x86_64.rpm

You can replace 0.48.0 with the latest version listed in the releases  .


---

✅ Step 2: Install it via RPM

sudo rpm -Uvh vector-0.48.0-1.x86_64.rpm

This installs the vector binary and sets up the necessary files.


---

✅ Step 3: Verify Installation

vector --version

Expected output:

vector 0.48.0 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)


---

✅ Step 4: Run Your Pipeline

Ensure your working files are in place:

cd /home/vncuser/vector-job
vector -c vector.yaml

Vector will now start consuming from flows, enrich records, and output to enriched-flows.


---

✅ Why This Works

Using the RPM directly bypasses errors in YUM repo configuration and ensures you're installing an official build  .
