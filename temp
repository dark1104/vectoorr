If you're getting vector: command not found, it means Vector.dev is not yet installed on your Linux VM.

Letâ€™s fix that step by step ðŸ‘‡


---

âœ… Step-by-Step: Install Vector on Linux VM (Debian/Ubuntu based)

ðŸ§­ Step 1: Add Vector Repository

curl -1sLf 'https://repositories.timber.io/public/vector/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash

ðŸ§± Step 2: Install Vector

sudo apt install vector

> This installs the vector binary globally to /usr/bin/vector.



ðŸ§ª Step 3: Verify Installation

vector --version

Expected output (example):

vector 0.36.0 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)


---

âœ… Step 4: Run Your Vector Job

Now navigate to your config folder and run:

cd /home/vncuser/vector-job
vector -c vector.yaml

âœ… Vector will:

Consume from Kafka topic flows

Map/transform the records

Output to Kafka topic enriched-flows

ðŸ›  Optional (Auto-run at boot)

You can later use Vector as a systemd service or even create a custom service for your own job if needed.

Let me know if:

You're on RHEL/CentOS instead â€” commands differ slightly.

You need help setting up Vector as a systemd service.

You want to enrich using the GeoLite2 MMDB files or Flask API in the Vector flow (like you did in Flink).


Need to define a mapping file b/w flow records coming from db and what is the corresponding coloumn in db . The mapping should have a name ,description , datatype , ismandatory and default value. If you recieve something that is not matching , we just need to stored that in a general coloumn in table  which should be in jsonb datatype.  This translation should happen in flink. Lets say you get 15 values from collector (goflow2) and we only have DB mapping for 10 values , the output kafka should have proper mapping for 10 values and remaning 5 values should be stored in json format in the coloumn to hold additional values.  this is a generic coloumn of jsonb type

need to do this without using flink and use https://vector.dev/
